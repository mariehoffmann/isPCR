# in-silico PCR
isPCR is an in silico PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tool, that allows to explore the efficiency of a primer pair on an arbitrary taxonomic branch. You can either explore the results visually or create a dump file listing for each lineages below the user-given root node coverage and resolution statistics w.r.t. species and genus levels.
